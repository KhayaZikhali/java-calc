This is basic calculator built using Reactjs

Its fully functioning with one minor bug.
The zero digit cannot be placed in the in index position zero or one in any number.
If the zero digit is entered in the index position zero or one then all subsequent digits entered will automatically be added together and displayed in the output screen until the page is reloaded.
